# Backend meets Frontend: Log in and log out of a web application with Vaadin
One big little thing about every web application is log-in and log-out. Also, the application should not simply throw the user out just by pushing the reload button. How this works with Vaadin shows this part of "Backend meets Frontend".


## How to start
To play with this you only have to start the main - method from the class  ```org.rapidpm.vaadin.helloworld.server.Main``` and 
go with your browser to the address: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

Ok, you got your first Vaadin "Hello World".
